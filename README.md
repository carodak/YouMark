Realization: Youtube channels sharing website

Used tools: HTML, CSS, PHP, Bootstrap (bootsnip), Javascript

Please kindly notice that the website was created during my third year of bachelor. We were a team of 4 people and had (at the time) written classes and comments in French.

Objective:

We had to design a useful and easy-to-use Social Bookmarking mini-tool.

We chose to work on the design of a website to enrich and expand our knowledge in the field of the Web. Moreover, as this project required a long process of reflection, we knew that it would be of great help in our future reflection and in our professional future.

See our report for more information.
